# eyeGUI
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raphaelmenges/eyeGUI.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/raphaelmenges/eyeGUI)

This library enables one to load, manipulate and render user interfaces for eyetracking input defined in xml files describing layouts. To use this library, there is a function based interface in a single header which requires the usage of C++11 and OpenGL 3.3 or higher. Layouts are thought as overlay for your specific application for interaction with the gaze input from an eyetracker, however one can create a whole application using layouts. For more information about usage, please visit the [**wiki**](https://github.com/raphaelmenges/eyeGUI/wiki)!

## HowTo
In order to use eyeGUI, please follow these steps:
* Generate a project for your compiler with CMake (somewhere on your computer)
* Compile that project (tested with GCC 5.x, Visual Studio 2015 and XCode)
* Inside your build folder chosen in CMake, there should be a folder called _lib_ containing the static library
* Just include the header from the _include_ folder into your project and link your executeable against the library
* Keep the licenses in mind! (at least, FreeType2 must be mentioned)

## Dependencies
* NanoSVG: https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg
* TinyXML2: https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2
* GLM: http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html (MIT license chosen)
* stb_image: https://github.com/nothings/stb
* FreeType 2.6.1: http://www.freetype.org/ (FreeType license chosen)
* utf8rewind: https://bitbucket.org/knight666/utf8rewind
* levenshtein-sse: https://github.com/addaleax/levenshtein-sse

All dependencies are already included inside the folder _externals_ and should be found by CMake. Keep the licenses in mind when you use this library in your project. The source code of this project itself in the folder _src_ and the header _eyeGUI.h_ from _include_ is licensed under the MIT license. From my point, it seems you only have to advertize the FreeType Library by mentioning it in your documentation or program when using the compiled library. Errors and omissions excepted ;)
